# PRD Workflow Skill

Implements Ryan Carson's 3-step structured AI coding workflow.

Instead of prompting an AI agent with a vague request and hoping for the best,
this workflow forces structured thinking: **define → plan → execute**.

## The 3 Steps

### Step 1 — PRD Generation (`rules/generate_prd.md`)

Reference this rule file and describe your feature. The agent asks clarifying
questions before writing anything, then produces `tasks/PRD.md` — a spec
written for a junior developer to understand.

### Step 2 — Task List Generation (`rules/generate_tasks.md`)

Reference this rule file with `tasks/PRD.md`. The agent proposes a high-level
plan and waits for your approval, then writes `tasks/TASKS.md` — a nested
checklist of atomic, ordered, testable sub-tasks.

### Step 3 — Systematic Execution (`rules/task_list_management.md`)

Reference this rule file with `tasks/TASKS.md`. The agent completes **one
sub-task at a time**, marks it `[x]` in `tasks/TASKS.md`, then stops.
You type "yes" to continue. Errors are caught early, preventing cascading failures.

## Usage

```bash
# Start a new feature
bash skills/prd-workflow/run.sh init

# Check progress on current task list
bash skills/prd-workflow/run.sh status

# Archive current tasks and start fresh
bash skills/prd-workflow/run.sh reset <feature-name>
```

## File Layout

```
rules/
  generate_prd.md           ← AI rule: ask questions, write PRD
  generate_tasks.md         ← AI rule: convert PRD to task list
  task_list_management.md   ← AI rule: execute tasks one at a time

tasks/
  PRD.md                    ← generated by Step 1
  TASKS.md                  ← generated by Step 2
  archive/                  ← old features archived by `reset`
```

## Why This Works

- **Slowing down speeds you up**: clarifying questions catch misunderstandings before code is written
- **Bite-sized tasks**: the agent can't go off the rails for more than one task at a time
- **Human checkpoints**: you review and approve every step
- **Persistent context**: `PRD.md` and `TASKS.md` survive context resets — the agent can always re-read them
